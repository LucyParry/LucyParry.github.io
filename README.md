# 💻 _n_ silly little websites 
A collection of strange little projects, the result of my fondness for - 

* The weird and wonderful 90s web of my early teens.
* Learning with lots of little projects like <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennfier Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days</a> or <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code</a>.
* Restraint in an ever more complex frontend JavaScript universe, and things like the <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">10k Apart competition</a> and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low-Tech Magazine</a>.
* Knowing that at their core, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are egalitarian, you can start building stuff with a text editor and a web browser.
