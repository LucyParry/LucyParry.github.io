TM470 is starting soon and I feel most anxious about the ‘reflective learning’ parts. Why do I hate doing such exercises so much? I know it’s good for you, I’ve read the nice PDFs, I’ve tried. I think about what I’ve done and how it made me feel constantly in my anxious head, and you don’t get too far in an OU degree without some level of self-awareness in your learning, but… crystallising it in writing feels so excruciating. I never maintain blogs or diaries either, why is it so uncomfortable for me? When has it actually helped me?

I need an idea too, seems like anything will be too much, not understood very well, or too small and just… crap.
